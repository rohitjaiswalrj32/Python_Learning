<a name="loops-for-while"></a>
## Loops for while

Learned how to repeat blocks of code using Python‚Äôs two primary loop types:

‚úÖ `for` loop ‚Äî Iterates over a sequence (like a range, list, or string)  
‚úÖ `while` loop ‚Äî Continues to run as long as a condition is true  
‚úÖ `break` ‚Äî Exits the loop immediately when a condition is met  
‚úÖ `continue` ‚Äî Skips the current iteration and continues with the next

üß† Used for tasks like printing sequences, calculating sums, and factorials.

‚úîÔ∏è Exercises Practiced:

- Print numbers from 10 to 1 (reverse order) using `for`  
- Print all even numbers from 1 to 20  
- Print characters of a name one by one  
- Generate the multiplication table for a number  
- Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N  
- Use `while` to print numbers from 1 to 100  
- Use `while` to print odd numbers between 50 and 70  
- Calculate factorial using a loop  
- Reverse a number using loop logic  
- Use `break` to exit loop on a specific condition  
- Use `continue` to skip specific values during iteration
