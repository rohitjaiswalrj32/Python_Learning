## 🔻 Conditional Statements (Control Flow)

Learned how to control the flow of a Python program using if, if-else, if-elif-else, and nested conditions.

Key concepts practiced:

✅ if — Executes a block only if condition is true  
✅ if-else — Executes one block if true, another if false  
✅ if-elif-else — Checks multiple conditions sequentially  
✅ Nested if — Condition inside another condition

🧠 Used for decision-making in real-world logic like grading, login systems, and eligibility checks.

✔️ Exercises Practiced:

- Positive, Negative, or Zero  
- Even or Odd Checker  
- Voting Eligibility  
- Largest of Three Numbers  
- Grading System  
- Leap Year Checker  
- Number in Range (1–100)  
- Simple Login System

## 🔁 Loops (for, while)

Learned how to repeat blocks of code using Python’s two primary loop types:

✅ `for` loop — Iterates over a sequence (like a range, list, or string)  
✅ `while` loop — Continues to run as long as a condition is true  
✅ `break` — Exits the loop immediately when a condition is met  
✅ `continue` — Skips the current iteration and continues with the next

🧠 Used for tasks like printing sequences, calculating sums, and factorials.

✔️ Exercises Practiced:

- Print numbers from 10 to 1 (reverse order) using `for`  
- Print all even numbers from 1 to 20  
- Print characters of a name one by one  
- Generate the multiplication table for a number  
- Calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to N  
- Use `while` to print numbers from 1 to 100  
- Use `while` to print odd numbers between 50 and 70  
- Calculate factorial using a loop  
- Reverse a number using loop logic  
- Use `break` to exit loop on a specific condition  
- Use `continue` to skip specific values during iteration

## ✅ Functions

Learned how to write reusable blocks of code using functions in Python.

### Key Concepts Covered:

- Defining a function with `def` keyword  
- Function parameters and arguments  
- Returning values from functions using `return`  
- Calling functions to execute code  
- Understanding **variable scope**:  
  - **Global variables** (defined outside functions, accessible everywhere)  
  - **Local variables** (defined inside functions, accessible only within)  
  - Using `global` keyword to modify global variables inside functions

## 🧩 Data Structures

Learned about and practiced Python’s core data structures:

- **Lists** — Ordered, mutable collections of elements  
- **Tuples** — Ordered, immutable collections of elements  
- **Sets** — Unordered collections of unique elements  
- **Dictionaries** — Key-value pairs, unordered and mutable  

Key operations covered:

- Creating, accessing, updating, and deleting elements  
- Iterating over each data structure  
- Common methods like append, remove, pop, keys, values, add, discard, etc.  
- Differences and appropriate use-cases for each data structure

## 📂 File Handling

Learned how to work with files in Python:

- Opening files using `open()` in different modes (`r`, `w`, `a`, `r+`)  
- Reading file contents (`read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`)  
- Writing data to files (`write()`, `writelines()`)  
- Closing files using `close()` or using context managers (`with` statement)  
- Handling file exceptions with try-except  
- Working with file paths and file operations
